# This is a testing ground for Python code

# Practice with nested function calls

# This is a nested function call to its extreme. Not very Pythonic
print(round(abs(float(input("Enter a whole positive number: ")))))

# I feel like this method is better
num = input("Enter a whole positive number: ")

num = round(abs(float(num)))

print(num)
